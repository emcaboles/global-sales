## Scenario
You are a data analyst at a global online store. The sales department needs your help in creating a report regarding the 2023 sales and the sales manager asked you to get the following data from you company's database using SQL.

1.  Find the top 5 countries with the highest total revenue from online orders.
2.  List the sales per region (North America, South America, Europe).
3.  List the products that have been ordered in every month of the dataset.
4.  List all products contained in bottles or jars or products that are sauces or syrup their supplier and their Location.
5.  Identify the top 10 products with the highest profit margin.
6.  Calculate the average order value for each product category.
7.  Identify the customer ID's who have made purchases on consecutive days.
8.  Calculate the average number of days between a customer's first and second order.
9.  Identify the customers who have made purchases in every product category.
10.  Find the average number of items per order for each customer.
11.  List the products that have been ordered by customers from at least 5 different countries.
12.  List the sales of each employee for the months of Aug and Sep 2023 from highest to lowest.

In addition, they want you to create a Power BI report showing the sales from Jul 2023 to present with the following details:
* Sales Over Time
* Key Performance Indicators:
	* Monthly and Total Sales
	* Monthly and Total Profit
	* Monthly and Total Orders
* Sales per Product Category
* Sales per Customer
* Orders, Sales, Profit per Product
* Ranking of Agents per Sales
* Agent Weekly Metrics:
	* Orders per Agent
	* Customer per Agent
	* Sales per Agent
	* Product Units Sold Per Agent
    
Also, there should be a filter for YTD, MTD, Dates, and Continent/Region where customers are located.

However, there is one catch. The 2024 sales and their corresponding details have not yet been uploaded in the database but is manually recorded and saved in an excel file. Since the data is manually recorded, the sales department also wants you to check if there are possible errors or outliers in the data.
